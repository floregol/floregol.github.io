            Students that are learning a discriminative task can be seen as <b>imperfect black box classifiers</b> undergoing training.
            <br> Besides one's learning capacities and environmental circumstances, a determining factor of success is the <b>material presented to them</b>. 
            If we view the student as a classification algorithm, then this selected material can be viewed as the training dataset. 
            Active learning is a branch of machine learning that develops methods to select the best training data that will lead to the optimal inference performance. 
            In a way, students themselves follow a similar strategy when they prioritize some material over other for their studies. 
            Moreover, this process is personalized since the student will of course tailor the selection to themselves; students will study harder on topics that are harder for them.
            This connection is more apparent if we consider a learning task where the training process of both human and computer share some similarities; i.e. when the human's learning process mainly consists of looking at a lot of examples. 
            As an example, to learn to identify tumor on patients, dentistry students will go over many benign and malign images. 
            <br>
            In a context like this one, can we apply active learning algorithm to <b>select the images shown to the student</b> that will improve their learning process? 
            An active learning algorithm could identify <i style="color:rgb(12, 71, 12);">which point on the input space</i> 
            $\rightarrow$ <i style="color:rgb(12, 71, 12);">which type of images</i>  
            would benefit the <i style="color:rgb(12, 71, 12);">classifier</i> $\rightarrow$

        The traditional inference problem is to obtain an estimate $\hat{p}(Y|X)$ 
        of some unknown target distribution $p^*(Y|X)$ given some datapoints
         $\mathcal{D} = \{x_i,y_i\}^N_{i=1}$ that are presumed to be IID realizations 
          $x, y \sim p^*(Y|X)p(X)$.
            Here, we consider a different problem. 
            An unknown agent $H$ is performing the traditional inference task of producing an 
            estimate given some data: $\hat{p}  = H(\mathcal{D})$, and <b>we want to find the data $\mathcal{D}$ that will help $H$ the most</b>. 
            We do not have direct access to that estimate $\hat{p}$, but we have control over the input data $\mathcal{D}$, and we can obtain samples from $y\sim \hat{p}(Y|X=x)$. To do so, our solution can be split in two.
            <br>
            Firstly, we approximate $\hat{p}$. With access to $\hat{p}$, 
            this would be a standard active learning problem. 
            However, since we do not have access to $\hat{p}$, we do not know how $H$ process 
            the information $\mathcal{D}$ to form it's estimate $\hat{p}$. 
            All we know is that $H$ is trying to learn $p^*$. 
            The first assumption that we make is that $H$ integrated the input data to its model
            : $\hat{p}  = H(\mathcal{D}) \implies y_i \sim \hat{p}(y_i|X=x_i)$.
            We then consider the alternate inference problem where $\hat{p}$ is 
            the target and frame it as a traditional inference problem:
            we obtain an estimate $h(Y|X)$ of some unknown target distribution $\hat{p}(Y|X)$ 
            given some datapoints $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_{init} \cup \{\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}\}$ where $\mathcal{D}_{init}$ is 
            the dataset initially fed to $H$: $\hat{p}(Y|X) = H(\mathcal{D}_{init})$ and $\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}$ are samples from the
             target estimate $\hat{P}$ $\tilde{x}, \tilde{y} \sim \hat{p}(Y|X=\tilde{x})$. 
             <br>
             Secondly, we perform active learning on our estimate $h(Y|X)$ of $\hat{p}$. Any active learning is suitable.
            To validate that our approach is working, we can test the performance of $\hat{p}_{al} = H(\mathcal{D}_{al})$ where $\mathcal{D}_{al}$ was obtained from our active learning approach and compare it to the performance of an other  estimator $\hat{p}_{r} = H(\mathcal{D}_{r})$ where $\mathcal{D}_{r}$ is obtained by random.
            
            </p><p style='text-align:center'>In our setting, $H$ is actually a human trying to learn a task.</centre></p>
