           When teaching something new to someone, we often have the intuition that if we present the 
           <b style="color:rgb(0, 98, 205);">right examples</b>, the person will learn faster.
        </p> 
       <p align="center"><img src="images/human_teach.png" alt="human teaching" width="300"></p>
       
    </p> 
    <p style='text-align:justify'>
        In machine learning, finding the best points to train an algorithm is called <b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);">Active Learning</b> (AL).
     </p> 
     <p align="center"><img src="images/comp_al.png" alt="computer teaching" width="300"></p>
     
 
 <p style='text-align:justify'>
    Sometimes, algorithms and humans are called to solve the same tasks. For example, both <b style="color:rgb(0, 98, 205);">medical students</b>  and
    <b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);">algorithms</b> learn to distinguish cancerous from benign images:
 </p> 
 <p align="center"> <img src="images/skin.png" alt="skin cancer classification" width="600"></p>
 <p align="center" ><small> (Figure taken from Esteva et al., Dermatologist-level classification
      of skin cancer with deep neural networks, 2017) </small></p>
 <p>
 
Hence, for a given task, their are helpful points  for humans
 <b style="color:rgb(0, 98, 205);"> $ \mathcal{D}^\mathcal{H} $</b> 
, and helpful points for algorithms  
<b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);"> $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{A}  $</b> that comes from the <b>same dataset</b> $\mathcal{D}$. 
</p> <p>
From there, a natural question to ask is whether there is an overlap between those two sets of helpful points?
</p>
<div class="article div highlight">
<h3>Research question:
    Is there an <b>overlap</b> between  <b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);"> $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{A}  $</b> and  <b style="color:rgb(0, 98, 205);"> $ \mathcal{D}^\mathcal{H} $</b>?</h3>
    <h4><span>&#8594;</span>  If the answer is yes, that means that showing <b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);"> $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{A}  $</b> to a human will help them learn faster.</h4>

        This is what we aim to verify in our experiment.

        <h2>The  experiment</h2>
        

         In summary, we compare the performance of humans that were shown random examples 
        to the performance of humans that were shown examples from <b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);"> $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{A}  $</b>. 
        <h3>Highlevel overview of the experimental steps</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The user arrives. </li>
        <li>Randomly select the <b>AL</b> or <b>Random</b> mode for that user.</li>
        <li>Show an initial training set $\mathcal{D}^{0}$ to the user.</li> 
        <li>If the user is in <b>Random</b> mode:</li> 
        <ul>
            <li> Randomly select another example from $\mathcal{D}$. </li>
            <li> The example and its label is shown to the user. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>If the user is in <b>AL</b> mode:</li> 
        <ul>
            <li> Select a random point from  <b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);"> $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{A}  $</b>.</li>
            <li> The example and its label is shown to the user. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Repeat the previous step a few times. </li>
        <li>Test the performance of the user:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Select an <b>unseen point</b>. </li>
            <li> The example is shown to the user <b>without</b> its label. </li>
            <li> The user is asked to provide the label of the example. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Repeat the previous step a few times. </li>
        <li>Store the user's performance (the fraction of their provided labels that were correct) with the <b>mode</b>.</li>
        </ul>

       
     </p>
     <h2>Preliminary Results</h2>
           Our preliminary results are interesting. Ealy results are leaning in 
           favor of our hypothesis: <p>In average, humans trained with <b style="color:rgb(217, 6, 6);"> $\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{A}  $</b>  <b>outperform</b> humans trained with random examples.
             However, this result does not come with statistical significance so it should not be taken as a definitive answer. More data is needed.

            <p align="center"> <b> Initial results for the color experiment. $N=40$, $AL=18$ $Random=22$. </b>**No statistical significance. </p>
            Also, we observed the interesting phenomenon during the testing phase. The accuracy or performance of humans <b>significantly improves</b>
            during the testing process, showing that the humans <b>keeps learning</b> as they are being tested.
